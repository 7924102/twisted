Compliance Notes
================

  These notes describe this implementation's compliance with WebDAV
and related standards.


DAV Level 2
-----------

  web2.dav does not (yet) implement (or advertise) DAV level 2
(locking) functionality.


Namespace Prefixes
------------------

  RFC2518bis section 4.3 says that servers SHOULD preserve XML
namespace prefixes in property values.

  Implementing this would require that we have explicit control in how
our XML renderer defines namespaces in its output, which defeats the
whole point of using XML, that being not having to write parsers and
generators.  Specifically, given this XML as input:

     <foo xmlns:X="http://twistedmatrix.com/ns/X"><X:bar/></foo>

an XML renderer might remove the prefix altogether:

     <foo><bar xmlns="http://twistedmatrix.com/ns/X"/></foo>

or it might change the prefix name ("X") to something else ("Y").
This is valid behaviour.

  The reason that preserving the prefixes is useful is that some other
XML standards, such as XSLT, apparently use the prefixes, which one
might argue is broken.  Since WebDAV doesn't depend on these
specifications, it is not reasonable to require that a WebDAV server
go too far out of its way to accomodate them.

  Anyway, web2.dav reads and writes XML data using an external library
(PyXML at present) and makes no effort to preserve namespace prefixes.
Rely on prefixes at your own peril.
